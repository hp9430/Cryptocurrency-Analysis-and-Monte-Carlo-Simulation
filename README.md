# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

We are trying to put risk in an investment in a single value (VaR) by simulating random market conditions and calculating loss for each market condition and then aggragating the results to establish a profile of the market's risk.

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:

Stock price evolution can be simulated by geometric brownian motion (GBM), which means we are assuming that all available public information is incorporated in the current price of the stock and the next price is conditionally independent of the past price.

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty

Startprice: It is the initial value of the stock before any market movements.

trials: We are trying to categorize results based on number of times the simalation is performed and analyze the value of VaR accordingly.
